## Exam content

### Response types

The exam includes two types of questions:

- **Multiple choice**: Has one correct response and three incorrect responses (distractors)
- **Multiple response**: Has two or more correct responses out of five or more response options

Multiple choice and multiple response: Select one or more responses that best complete the statement or answer the question. Distractors, or incorrect answers, are response options that a candidate with incomplete knowledge or skill might choose. Distractors are generally plausible responses that match the content area.

On the exam, unanswered questions are scored as incorrect. There is no penalty for guessing. The exam includes 50 questions that affect your score. These questions include multiple-choice questions and multiple-response questions. Each scored multiple-choice question and each scored multiple-response question counts as a single scored opportunity.

### Unscored content

The exam includes 15 unscored questions that do not affect your score. AWS collects information about performance on these unscored questions to evaluate these questions for future use as scored questions. These unscored questions are not identified on the exam.

## Exam results

The AWS Certified CloudOps Engineer - Associate (SOA-C03) exam has a pass or fail designation. The exam is scored against a minimum standard established by AWS professionals who follow certification industry best practices and guidelines.

Your results for the exam are reported as a scaled score of 100â€“1,000. The minimum passing score is 720. Your score shows how you performed on the exam as a whole and whether you passed. Scaled scoring models help equate scores across multiple exam forms that might have slightly different difficulty levels.

Your score report could contain a table of classifications of your performance at each section level. The exam uses a compensatory scoring model, which means that you do not need to achieve a passing score in each section. You need to pass only the overall exam.

Each section of the exam has a specific weighting, so some sections have more questions than other sections have. The table of classifications contains general information that highlights your strengths and weaknesses. Use caution when you interpret section-level feedback.
